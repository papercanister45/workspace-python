#Elif grade is lower than 80 and greater than or equal to 60, then print
#"probation". Else, print "failing". 

grade = 22

if grade=>80:
    print("passing")

elif grade=<60:
    print("probation")
#2) Make a int variable named a. Now make an if/elif statment, and if a is more
#than/equal too 100 or less than/equal too -100, print "a is a three digit 
#number". Elif a is between 100 and -100, print "a is not a three digit number".

a = 55

    if a >= 100 or a <= -100
        print("a is a three digit") 
    elif a = 100 and -100
#3)Create a variable called age. Make an if/else statement. If age is older
#than 18, print "You can vote". Else, print "You cannot vote".

age if > 18:
    print("you can vote")
    else 
    print("you cannot vote")
    

#4)Make a string variable called answer, and set it to the letter a, b, c, or d.
#Make an if/elif statement. If answer is a, b, or d, print "Wrong". Elif answer
#is c, print "Correct".

"answer" = a, b, c, or d:
    if "answer" = a, b, or de
    print("wrong")
    elif "answer" = c
    print("correct")
#5)Make two boolean variables. Make an if/elif/else statement. If both booleans 
#are true, print "Both". Elif only one of the booleans is true, print "Only 
#one". Else, print "Neither".

a =True 

b= False 

if a or b 
    print("both")
elif a 
    print("only one")
else b
    ("neither")
