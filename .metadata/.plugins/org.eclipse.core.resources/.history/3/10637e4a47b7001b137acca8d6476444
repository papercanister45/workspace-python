#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

A = 47 

a = 47.47 

B = "Sandal"

b = True 

C = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

a = 13

A= 13.1

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

A = "greef"

A = "Green"

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

C = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

G = ["table", "sweater", "egg"]
G = G[1]

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:

N = "Zavon"

j = N[0]

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(j)

print(G)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors
