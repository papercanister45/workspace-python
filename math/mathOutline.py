#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

orangeJuice = "orange" + "juice" 

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

twentyOne = 9 + 10  

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

zero = 20 - 20 

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

pointOne = 1.00 - 0.99

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

rabbit = 2 * 3 

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

carrot = "rabbit" * 30 

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

forty = 80 / 20 
#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

boat = 0.45 / 0.45 

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

yes = 37 % 44 

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

remainder = 55 // 2 

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

up = 33 ** 333

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

"yup" = nope + 2342
