#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

apple = "apples" == "apple juice"

print(apple)
#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

oranges = 99 == 98 

print(oranges)
#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

number = 44 > 43

print(number)
#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

popeyes = 999 < 2020

print(popeyes)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

var5 = 27 >= 277

print(var5)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

green = 33 <= 23 

print(green)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

var6 = eggs<==>44
