#1) Make a int variable called x set to 0. Make a while loop that prints 
#out x and increments it by one. Make the loop run while x is less than
#or equal to 20.

x = 0
while x <= 20:
    print(x)
    x = x+1
    
#2) Make a int variable called x set to 0. Make a while loop that prints 
#out x and increments it by one. Add an if statement that breaks the loop
#if x equals 15. Make the loop run while x is less than 100.

x= 0 
while x < 100:  
    print(x)
    x = x+1 
    if x == 15:
        break 
#3) Make a int list with three items inside. Make a for loop that prints 
#out all the items.

var1 = [1, 2, 3]
for x in var1:
    print(x)

#4) Make a string list with three items inside: "Michael", "Chris", "Nino". 
#Make a for loop that prints out all the items. Add an if statement that 
#breaks the loop if the item equals "Chris".

gg = ["Michael", "Chris", "Nino"]
for x in gg:
    print(x) 
    if x == "Chris":
        break 
#5) Make a while loop with a common SYNTAX error.

jj = 47
    while x > 50
    print(while)
#6) Make a for loop with a common SYNTAX error.

gg = ["Michael", "Chris", "Nino"]
for x in gg
    pnt(x) 
    if x == "Chris"
        break
